## PARA Method

The PARA (or P.A.R.A.) method is a simple organization system that’s part of the Building a Second Brain methodology. PARA divides notes into four containers: Projects (active projects), Areas (goals and long-term commitments), Resources (reference materials), and Archives (completed/canceled/deferred projects). 

* 📂 **Folder #1: [Projects](./projects/)**
  * These are active projects you’re working on. Projects have a fixed timeline, clear deadlines, and specific tasks you need to complete. Most people have five to fifteen projects going on at the same time. Projects can be anything from writing a book to developing an app or learning a new language. 
* 📂 **Folder #2: [Areas](./areas/)**
  * Areas are long-term responsibilities and future goals. They focus on specific domains in your life like health, finance, or self-development. Areas are umbrella categories and can spawn individual projects. For instance, the area of “health” can lead to projects like “lose 20 pounds” or “prepare for Ironman 2023.”
* 📂 **Folder #3: [Resources](./resources/)**
  * Think of Resources as your Misc folder. If you come across something interesting that doesn’t have a clear connection to one of the active projects or areas, you dump it here. You can create Resources for hobbies and interests, life hacks, or any other topics you may want to reference at some point in the future.
* 📂 **Folder #4: [Archives](./archive/)**
  * The Archives folder includes completed, canceled, or deferred projects. Any projects you’re not actively working on should end up in the Archives folder. The Archives are a valuable resource when starting new projects, so you should get into the habit of moving notes here rather than deleting them.
